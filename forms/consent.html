<i>This consent form, a copy of which will be left with you for your records and reference, is only part of the process of informed consent. It should give you the basic idea ofwhat the research is about and what your participation will involve. If you would likemore detail about something mentioned here, or information not included here, you should ask. Please take the time to read this carefully and to understand anyaccompanying information.</i><br/><br/>

<b>Purpose</b>: This experiment examines your ability to remember words. Your performance will be compared to computational models of semantic memory. This is done so in an effort to assess if they are descriptive models of human behavior.<br/><br/>

<b>Procedure</b>: 
If you agree to participate in this study, you will study lists of word pairs and then will be asked to remember those words on a later memory test. Further, when you study the word pairs, you may be asked to perform one kind of extra action on one of the words from each pair (e.g. you may be asked to type or say aloud a word). At test, you will be asked to recognize presented words from a list of presented and non-presented words. The entire study should take about 20 minutes to complete. The tasks will be conducted in the lab.<br/><br/>

<b>Risks and benefits</b>:
There are typically no risks involved, greater than that which you might experience in the normal conduct of your everyday. If you become tired, you should take a break. You are free to discontinue participation at any time and with no consequences. You will benefit from participating by gaining experience with scientific research in psychology.<br/><br/>

<b>Your privacy</b>: Digital data files will be anonymous and kept indefinitely on a password protected laboratory computer. Hard copies of your data files will be anonymous and kept indefinitely in a file cabinet in the Cognitive Science laboratory at the University of Manitoba. This consent form will be kept in a cabinet in the Cognitive Science laboratory at the University of Manitoba. It will be destroyed on April 1, 2024.<br/><br/>

<b>Compensation</b>: You will receive 1 credit toward your final grade in Introductory Psychology (Psychology 1200).<br/><br/>

<b>Voluntary withdrawal</b>: Even after you consent to participate in the experiment, you can choose to withdraw your participation at any time and with no consequence. You will be debriefed and then you are free to leave the experiment without penalty. If you withdraw part way through the experiment, your data will be automatically deleted. If you withdraw after completing the experiment, your data will not be deleted as there is no way to link your identity to your response data.</b></i><br/><br/>

<b>Feedback</b>: At the end of the study after you have completed your responses, a page will be displayed that explains the details of the study, including the hypotheses and a list of relevant readings to follow-up on if you are interested<br/><br/>

<b>Dissemination</b>: The results of the study will be presented at academic conferences and published in academic journals. Results will also be part of a thesis.<br/><br/>
