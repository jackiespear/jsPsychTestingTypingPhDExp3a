# jsPsychTestingTypingPhDExp2a
Experiment 3a of my PhD Thesis. Testing effet by typing using words from Johns and Swanson (1988).

This experiment is involves a testing effect procedure followed by a standard yes/no recognition memory test.

During the study phase, participants will be presented with word pairs. One half of these word pairs will be completed intact word pairs, and one half will be a completion paired with a stem (e.g HOT - COLD or HOT - ?). Subjects will be instructed to provide/generate an incomplete word pair by typing, or to simply read the intact word pair.

Both pure and mixed lists will be used.

Each participant will be presented with a total of 40 word pairs during the study phase.

In the pure-read condition, in the study phase, participants will be presented with all of the 40 intact cue-target pairs (e.g. task - save), where they will then proceed straight to the recognition test.

In the pure-test condition, the study phase will be blocked, such that participants will see four intact cue-target pairs and then be given a test phase for the second word in each of the four pairs (e.g. task - ?). Participants will be asked to type the corresponding word for each pair in the space provided. This study/test cycle of presenting four cue-target pairs, and then testing the second word in each pair, will continue ten times, such that the total number of study cue-target pairs will be 40. Once this cycle is completed, participants will proceed to the standard yes/no recognition test.

In the mixed-list test condition, the study phase will again be blocked, such that participants will see four intact cue-target pairs, but then participants will be presented with only half of the incomplete cue-target pairs (two), where they will be asked to recall and type the second word in the space provided (e.g. park - ?). Again, this study/test cycle of presenting four cue-target pairs, and then testing two of the four cue-target pairs, will be repeated ten times, such that the total number of cue-target pairs that are studied is 40, and the total number of cue-target pairs that are tested is 20. Once this cycle is completed, participants will proceed to the standard yes/no recognition test.

In all three conditions, when participants proceed onto the recognition test phase, they will be presented with the second word in each pair that was studied, along with an equal number of unstudied single word lures. Test words will be presented one at a time, in the center of the screen, in black font. Each trial will persist until the participant responds “yes” or “no”.

Participants will then be tested for their recognition of the second word in each pair, one at a time, along with an equal amount of new, unstudied lures (80 words in total).
